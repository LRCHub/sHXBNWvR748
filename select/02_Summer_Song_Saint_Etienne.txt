And then you will
And then you won't
And then you do
And then you don't

Just when I wanted to
Seems like the summer's through
Take a trip to the ocean
Look around, look around
Feel that emotion

Give me back the summer time
I can't stand this rain
Give me back the summer time
Let me start again
Let me start again

I don't know what I was thinking of
I said so many things I regret
You and me don't have to let it go
We've got so much left to do
So much to lose
I can't do without you

Give me back the summer time
I can't stand this rain
Give me back the summer time
Let me start again

Give me back the summer time
Tell me what to do
Give me back the summer time
Back to me and you
Back to me and you

Take me back
Take me back to summer time
It's time

And then you will
And then you won't
